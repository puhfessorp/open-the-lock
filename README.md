# Open the Lock

Once upon a late night coding, I ran across the following puzzle in my social media feed:

Can you open the lock using these clues? (Drawing of a padlock with room for three digits)

682: One digit is right and in its place
614: One digit is right but in the wrong place
206: Two digits are right but both are in the wrong place
738: All digits are wrong
380: One digit is right but in the wrong place

I remember trying this puzzle once before while tired and distracted, but failing miserably. Tonight I decided to give it another go, but from a different perspective.

Would it be possible to write a python program to solve this, using a simple brute force technique?

Spoiler: Yes, yes it is possible
